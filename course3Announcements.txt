<d2l-html-block html="<p><strong>Welcome to the Brightspace course for SI Session Information for Spring 2024 courses! We&amp;#39;re glad you are here. Here are a couple of guidelines for you:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why am I seeing this Brightspace Course?</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
<li style=&quot;list-style-type: inherit;&quot;>You can access this SI Session Information Brightspace course because a class you are taking is supported by SI, and we have automatically enrolled you in it so you can access the SI resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Supplemental Instruction?</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
<li>Supplemental Instruction is a program built around&amp;#160;peer-led group study sessions for some of Purdue’s most challenging courses.</li>
<li>Our SI Leaders are undergraduate students at Purdue who have taken the course that they are assigned to lead and know what it takes to succeed.</li>
<li>They are trained to facilitate or guide learning through fun, collaborative activities that provide more practice with challenging course material and concepts.</li>
<li>SI attendance is correlated with higher grades in the paired course, but it should not be thought of as a quick fix or a place to go for last minute help before an exam.</li>
<li>To get the most benefit, you should attend SI early in the semester and continue coming as often as you can.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that 1 hour of productive group study is equal to 2 hours of solo studying –&amp;#160;SI helps you maximize your study time while also getting to know your peers and having fun.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do I participate?</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
<li style=&quot;list-style-type: inherit;&quot;>SI sessions will be in-person for Spring 2024.</li>
<li style=&quot;list-style-type: inherit;&quot;>Each SI supported course has its own folder within this Brightspace course, which you can see in the menu on the left of your screen.</li>
<li style=&quot;list-style-type: inherit;&quot;>Within these folders, you can see the SI Leader’s schedule, which includes their session locations, times and their weekly office hour.</li>
<li style=&quot;list-style-type: inherit;&quot;>Drop by and see your SI Leader in-person by visiting the Academic Success Center, or virtually by clicking the office hour Zoom link in the course folder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What should I expect from SI?</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
<li style=&quot;list-style-type: inherit;&quot;>The SI Leader will guide you through activities, and you will collaborate with fellow peers to solve problems and find solutions.</li>
<li style=&quot;list-style-type: inherit;&quot;>An SI Leader’s role is to facilitate the discussion that will lead to you and your peers figuring out the answer, so often times SI Leaders will redirect questions instead of just answering it themselves.</li>
<li style=&quot;list-style-type: inherit;&quot;>When a student is able to explain information to their peers, they are creating an even stronger grasp on the information, which is why 1 hour of SI is equal to 2 hours to individual studying.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if sessions/office hours change?</strong></p>
<p>Any temporary session or office hour updates or changes throughout the semester will be posted to the Spring 2024 Brightspace SI Brightspace Course.</p>
