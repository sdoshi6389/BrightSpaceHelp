<d2l-html-block html="<p>First-year computer science majors (those starting in summer 2023 or later) have the opportunity to complete a Micro-credential in Multicultural Teamwork. This credential certifies the student’s investment in their competence to work on and contribute productively to multicultural teams.&amp;#160; Students have a full year to complete the credential, i.e., if they start at the beginning of the spring semester, they have until the end of the following fall semester to complete it. <b>Enrollment is open during the first 4 weeks of the semester: January 8- February 2, 2024</b>.</p>
<p>Students engage with a series of five Portable Intercultural Modules (PIMs), three required and two of their choice. Each module addresses Purdue’s Embedded Learning Outcomes of Interpersonal Skills and Intercultural Knowledge and/or Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. The modules are designed as autonomous learning experiences that can be completed in 60-90 minutes. The modules are housed in Brightspace. Students who register for the program are enrolled in this non-credit “course”.</p>
<p>Upon completion of each module, the student is awarded a digital intercultural learning badge, highlighting key learning outcome(s), which can be displayed on social media and their personal webpage. Once the student completes all 5 modules, they write a Capstone Reflection about what they have learned regarding working with people from cultural backgrounds different from their own. When this task is satisfactorily completed, the student is issued a micro-credential attesting to their investment in developing their multicultural teamwork skills, including the intercultural skills of self-awareness, verbal and non-verbal communication, curiosity, openness, empathy, and knowledge of worldview frameworks. After a year of enrollment, the student is unenrolled from the program, whether they have completed it or not.</p>

<p>This page is designed to be a repository of resources that you will find useful during your time at Purdue University and pursuing a degree in Computer Science, Data Science, or Artificial Intelligence. While most of these resources exist outside of this Brightspace page, we wanted to create a central location to easily find resources you may need throughout your time at Purdue.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>If there are resources you find yourself using frequently, you can bookmark them to quickly find them again.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Make sure to subscribe to the calendar to be aware of events, seminars, etc. that are being hosted by the department or affiliated with one of our student organizations.&amp;#160;</p>
